        <h1> Welcome to <em>Jonathan's</em> Programming Portfolio! <h1>
            <p> Hi my name is Jonathan Lakavichit I graduated from Cranston Highschool West and I decided to admit to URI.
            This website is all about me using my knowledge from what I've learned from the Khan Academy videos and lectures in using HTML.
            This website that I am making is basically an assignment. I have to add an image of a banner and two buttons which is the Javascript and the about me.
            I am supposed to make a title, a header and type a paragraph on what this website is about. 
            I am also using github.com to make this website. I enjoy programming and I wish to know more about it in the future.</p>
