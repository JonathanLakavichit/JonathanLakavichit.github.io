        <h1> Welcome to <em>Jonathan's</em> Programming Portfolio! <h1> <br>
            <p> Hi my name is Jonathan Lakavichit and I live in Cranston Rhode Island. I grew up in South Providence orginally.
            I went to Flynn elementary school but it unfortunately closed down so I moved to another elementary school.
            It was called Veazie elementary school. After 5th grade then I moved to Cranston where I went to Glenn Hills,
            Western Hills Middle School and Cranston Highschool West. I enjoy watching and playing soccer. I also like to play video games on my Xbox and PC.
            I play video games such as Fifa, Minecraft, Rocket League, etc...</p>
